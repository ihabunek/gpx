# To-do list

A random collection of ideas for this project.

## Analytical

- [ ] better elevation gained/lost algorithm which takes into account the little
      changes in elevation due to the inaccuracy of the sensor

## Technical

- [ ] store parsed tracks on S3 for future reference - this would enable
      re-parsing if the parsing algorithm changes/improves
